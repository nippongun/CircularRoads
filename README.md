# ConvexHull
This project is going to create a convex hull which is represented in the Unity Engine.
The created points help to add cubic spline interpolation. With these splines, it is possible to create a mesh and eventually
creating a race track based on that.

# Concept

1. 
  >A certain amount of pseudo-random points are created in a certain range.
2.
>Based on Graham's scan, a hull is created which provides the "outer most" points (rubberband analogy)

3.
>Visualization of the lines with ```Debug.DrawLine()```
4. 
>(To be continued...)
